\subsection{Background}
\label{sub:Background}

During my year in industry, I spent a large amount of time maintaining and
developing with Enterprise messaging systems - such as
\href{http://www.tibco.com/products/automation/enterprise-messaging/enterprise-message-service}{TibcoEMS}
and \href{https://www.rabbitmq.com/}{RabbitMQ}. These systems were of great
interest to me, as they invisibly

\subsection{Overview}
\label{sub:Overview}

My project centers around building an enterprise-style messaging broker,
as an exercise in understanding the various challenges associated with middleware
communications under various networking conditions. These conditions will be
representative of the various different environments an application is expected
to operate in. For example, an Internet of Things device that wishes to send information back
to a cloud-based data collector - has a fundamentally different set of priorities
to a server exchanging messages within a local datacenter, say as part of a large
financial application. For example - an \gls{iot} device may
have constrains placed on its battery life - meaning that reducing the amount of
energy consumed in sending each message would take precedence over the
requirement to, say, deliver messages in order. My project will center around
designing and implementing various 'strategies' for meeting the kinds of SLA
found in these discreet environment - and evaluating the performance of each
strategy under various different workloads and scenarios. Time permitting,
I also hope to be able to explore the idea and effect of switching strategies
on the fly, in response to changing operating conditions.

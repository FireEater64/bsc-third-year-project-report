\section{Background}
\label{sec:background}

Many large, distributed applications (particularly in 'enterprise' environments)
make extensive use of messaging brokers - software\footnote{Or hardware in some
cases\cite{solaceappliances}} responsible for passing layer-7 messages between
services, over the network. Two examples of message brokers are
\href{http://www.tibco.com/products/automation/enterprise-messaging/enterprise-message-service}{TibcoEMS}
and \href{https://www.rabbitmq.com/}{RabbitMQ}. These brokers improve the
software development experience for engineers working on distributed
applications, by abstracting away the complexities involved with passing
messages between software running on distributed, heterogeneous hardware - which
may be seperated by networks operated by multiple different administrators, and
with less-than-perfect
qualities.\footnote{\url{https://blogs.oracle.com/jag/resource/Fallacies.html}}. These broker benefits are explored in-depth in Section~\ref{sec:brokers}.

\href{https://golang.org/}{GoLang} is a modern, cross-platform, open-source
programming language initially developed by Google, and designed primarily for
systems programming, with a focus on writing performant, network-oriented
software, such as \href{https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes}{service
cluster managers}, \href{https://github.com/mholt/caddy}{web-servers} and
\href{https://github.com/grafana/grafana}{monitoring software}\footnote{Grafana
is used to provide monitoring and dashboarding for this project - see
Section~\ref{sec:presentation}}. More information on GoLang can be found in
Section~\ref{sec:GoLang}

\section{Goals}
This project centers around building an enterprise-style messaging broker,
as an exercise in designing network-oriented distributed applications using a modern, novel programming language (GoLang), whilst following software design, test and architecture best practices - such as unit-testing, continuous integration, and built-in monitoring.

In (very) broad strokes, my project has the following goals:

 \begin{itemize}
   \item Evaluate the impact and usefulness of GoLangs concurrency primitives in
   constructing and testing a highly performant piece of software.
   \item Design and build a high-performance, well-tested, stable message broker
   in GoLang.
   \item Evaluate the performance and feature-set of my implementation in
   comparison with popular open-source alternatives.
 \end{itemize}

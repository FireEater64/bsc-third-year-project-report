\subsection{Messages}
\label{sub:Messages}

In todays interconnected world, computer programs rarely exist in a vacuum.
Rather, they form one small part of a much larger \gls{soa} -
consisting of multiple services, jobs and scripts, all exchanging information in
the form of messages. These messages may adhere to a standard data-interchange
format (for example, \gls{json}). They may correspond to an agreed upon
specification (for example, \href{https://goo.gl/rjuP4C}{IEEE 1671-2010}).
Or they may simply be blobs of binary information transmitted over the network -
completely subject to the interpretation of the sender and received.
At a fundamental level, though, a message is simply a collection of bytes, to be
transmitted from point A, to point B.

\subsection{Message Brokers}
\label{sub:What is a message broker?}

\end{figure}

To understand the role message brokers typically play in \glspl{soa}, we first
examine the simplest method of transmitting bytes between two applications -
directly transmitting messages between two applications (shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:tikz:directMessaging}).

In this example, the application 'A' wishes to transmit a simple message
(a sequence of bytes) to application 'B', and does so in the simplest method
possible. This could involve making an \gls{rpc}, opening a Unix/\gls{tcp} socket,
or making a HTTP web request - for the purposes of this illustration the exact
mechanism by which bytes are transferred is unimportant, the fact
that the transfer takes place \emph{directly} between the two parties is all that
matters.

\subsubsection{Queues}
\label{subs:Queues}

Brief overview of the features/operation of a queue, in relation to a message broker.


\subsubsection{Topics}
\label{subs:Topics}

Brief overview of the features/operation of a topic, in relation to a message broker.

\subsubsection{Existing Brokers}
\label{subs:Existing Brokers}

Brief overview and comparison between some existing commercial/open-source
implementations, and their features.

\subsection{Goals}
 In (very) broad strokes, my project has the following goals:

 \begin{itemize}
   \item Evaluate the impact and usefulness of GoLangs concurrency primatives in
   constructing and testing a highly performant piece of software.
   \item Evaluate the effort and time required to construct infrastructure
   software comparable in functionality to existing commercial solutions.
   \item Explore novel methods of increasing the performance of message passing,
   in different environments.
 \end{itemize}

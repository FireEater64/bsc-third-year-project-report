This report details an exercise in learning and evaluating the 'Go' programming
language, by building a feature-rich application message broker using modern
software engineering techniques and best practises. Some of the unique features
of Go are presented, and the importance and relevance of these features in
building simple, high-performance distributed software is explored. Discussion
of the novel 'CSP-style' concurrency features in Go lead to an unorthodox design
proposal for an enterprise-style messaging broker - the implementation of which
is then described and critiqued. Finally, the process and results of the software
testing are presented, and analysed.
